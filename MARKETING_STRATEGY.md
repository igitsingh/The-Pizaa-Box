## PHASE 1: COMPETITOR AUDIT (MEERUT & PRABHAT NAGAR)

| Competitor | Strength | Weakness | Winning Angle |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Domino's** | Speed, Eco-pizzas (₹59), Tech stack. | Industrial taste, thin toppings, expensive premium veg. | Focus: "Authentic, Hand-Crafted, Loaded Veggies". |
| **Pizza Wings** | Local favorite, 4.9/5 stars, BOGO offers. | Limited menu variety beyond wings/pizza. | Angle: "More Than Just Wings - The Complete Italian Experience". |
| **La Pino'z** | Giant Pizzas (Monster 24"), Variety. | Very expensive (~₹850 for two), inconsistent quality. | Angle: "Premium Quality, Affordable Price". |
| **Ovenstory** | Unique cheese bases, value combos. | Digital-only feel, confusing pricing. | Angle: "Simple. Fresh. Real Cheese." |

### 🚀 Quick Wins Identify:
1. **The "Bestseller" FOMO:** We must tag items as "Most Ordered in Prabhat Nagar".
2. **Bulk Orders:** Target Shubh Labh/Occasions in Meerut with specific combos.
3. **Late Night:** "Hungry at 11 PM? We're open." (Even if only for pickup/limited delivery).
